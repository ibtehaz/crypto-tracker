              What is cryptocurrency?
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="faq-answer">
            A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp#toc-what-is-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[1]</a>

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="faq-answer">
            A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.
